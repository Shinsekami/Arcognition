# Arcognition

Arcognition is a simple online tool that finds furniture from any room image and gathers shopping links.

[**Open Arcognition**](https://<your-username>.github.io/Arcognition)

## How It Works
1. Upload an image or paste a direct image URL.
2. Click **Process** and wait a few seconds.
3. Download the Excel report listing furniture items, prices, websites, and links.

Use it to identify pieces from moodboards, real rooms, or 3D renders and quickly compare prices.

### ⚙️ For Developers
The backend runs on Google Cloud Run using FastAPI to handle detection, reverse search, and scraping before returning an Excel file.
